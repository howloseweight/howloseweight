<em>The Marilu Henner diet recipes</em> includes foods that contain fiber. Great source of fiber – whole grains (cereals). This is not the same cereal that you hated in childhood. Keep in mind the same principle as with vegetables – discover their taste again. There are many ways to cook grits. Everyone knows that barley is placed in the soup, but it can be well prepared for breakfast. This is a healthy and nutritious food, especially in winter. Barley can be added in summer salads such as salad with cranberries, onions and parsley. You can make a hearty salad of barley, lean meat and beans.
<p>Avoid consumption of candy, cakes, cereal, and other processed foods that contain white sugar, since it is harmful carbohydrate. Most people consider that sugar is a neutral ingredient. They know that it is not useful, but do not believe that sugar can be harmful. This is a misconception. Sugar is not an innocent supplement. </p><p></p>

</div>Many studies have found an association of sugar consumption with considerable and abrupt changes of mood, as well as digestive problems and with a decrease in brain activity. Sugar affects the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the stable condition of the body and restoring of it after the pain and stress. It can cause disruption of the blood and lymphatic system, as well as to disfunction of red blood cells.
<p>Sugar contains minimal nutrients, so sweet food intake leads to depletion of vitamins, minerals and amino acids in the organism. A large number of refined sugar can become a poison that fills the bloodstream. This is called carbon poisoning, it is caused by the accumulation of harmful substances in the central nervous system.
